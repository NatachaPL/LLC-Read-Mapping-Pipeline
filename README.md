# LLC-Read-Mapping-Pipeline
Implementation code for my MSc in Bioinformatics thesis project.

The goal was to develop a mapping tool with high coverage and precision by adopting hash-based
approaches to increase the search space over the reference genome with the generation of multiple
keys for each read, taking into account quality information and biological constraints. The mapping will be definitive after a positive alignment of the read with the genome, using algorithms based
in the Needleman-Wunsch method.
